              <h1> Ways to Show Support</h1>
            <h2>  1. Do you want to talk about it? I’m here when you’re ready.</h2>
            You can’t force someone to talk, but knowing you’re available can really help them feel supported.

            <h2>2. What can I do to help today?</h2>
            Depression often causes fatigue, trouble sleeping, and a lack of motivation. Sometimes just getting out of bed can be hard.
            Asking what you can do can really help them through their day.

           <h2>WHAT NOT TO SAY</h2> 
            Just remember: Advice isn’t the same as asking for help. If they ask for your advice, give it if you so choose. But don’t offer them “helpful” solutions or statements that seem like a cure for their depression. This can feel judgmental or not empathetic.

              DON’T say:

              “Just think happy thoughts. I don’t understand what you have to be so sad about.”
              “Everything will be OK, I promise.”
              “I cut out sugar and I was cured! You should try it.”
              “You just need to snap out of this.”
              “So many people out there are worse off than you.”

              <h2>3. You’re important to me.</h2>
              It’s always nice to know you’re loved or wanted. When someone’s depressed, they may feel the exact opposite.

             <h2> 4. I’m really sorry you’re going through this. I’m here for you if you need me.</h2>
             The fact is, there’s no perfect thing to say to someone living with depression. Your words won’t cure them. But they can help.

              Reminding someone that you’re there for them whenever they need you — whether that’s in the form of help with a small task or someone to call in a crisis — can be so essential to saving a life.

                <h1><strong>Warning signs for suicide</strong></h1>
                <h2>Talk</h2>
                What a person says can be an important indicator of suicidal ideations. If someone talks about killing themselves, feeling hopeless, being a burden, having no reason to live, or feeling trapped, be concerned.


              <h2>Behavior</h2>
              A person’s behavior, especially when related to a big event, loss, or change, can be an indicator of suicide risk. Behaviors to watch for include:

             1. increased use or misuse of substances
             2. looking for a way to end their life, such as searching online for methods
             3.  withdrawing from activities and isolating from family and friends
             4. visiting or calling people to say goodbye
             5.  giving away prized possessions or acting reckless
             6. other symptoms of depression, such as aggression, fatigue, and sleeping too much or too little

             <h2>Mood</h2>

             Depression is the most common condition that’s associated with suicide.

              Depression, anxiety, loss of interest, or irritability are all moods that can indicate someone is considering suicide. They may display one or more of these moods in varying degrees.

              Depression, if left untreated or undiagnosed, is especially dangerous.
