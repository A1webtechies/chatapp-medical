  <h1>Boosting Motivation When You’re Depressed</h1>

  <h2>1. Get out of bed and out of pajamas</h2>
  The simple act of getting up is a good first victory of the day. Leave a few sticky notes with positive affirmations where you can see them, such as: “Yes, you can do it,” “Every long journey starts with one step,” or “Never give up!” Your brain digests whatever thoughts you create, so feed it positive ones.

  <h2>2. Go for a walk</h2>
  Exercise helps your body release endorphins, the feel-good hormones. Exercising for at least 35 minutes a day, five days a week, can improve symptoms of mild to moderate depression. It may also help treat more severe forms of depression.

  <h2>3. Get your hands dirty to get a mood lift</h2>
  According to a studyTrusted Source with mice, a certain type of bacteria found in dirt (Mycobacterium vaccae) may enhance the production of serotonin. Serotonin in turn helps decrease the symptoms of depression.

  Bacteria found in fermented foodsTrusted Source, such as yogurt, can also enhance moods by reducing anxiety and potentially improving symptoms of depression.

  <h2>4. Don’t overschedule</h2>
  If you can only accomplish one or two tasks, that’s fine. Congratulate yourself for every task or goal you complete, no matter how small. That will help improve your confidence and sense of motivation.

  <h2>5. Avoid negativity</h2>
  Reading the news or surfing the internet, talking to people who leave you feeling drained and negative, or revisiting sad topics —these activities can all have an impact on your mood and motivation. Instead, focus on feelings of gratitude. Read uplifting content and surround yourself with positive people.

  <h2>6. Stick to a routine</h2>
  Write down your routine, stick it on the wall or somewhere you will see it, and use check marks when you’ve completed tasks. The sense of having accomplished daily tasks will promote a sense of well-being and inspire you to aim higher each day.

  You could also keep a journal as part of your routine. Journals are a good place to dispose of negative thoughts and make room for the positive.
